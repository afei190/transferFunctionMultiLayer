This is the transfer function educational tool.
</h1>

<p>
This open-source education application evaluates transfer function of multiple layers. The user is able to add/delete layers to the system and evaluate the effect of charateristics of each layer, including thickness, density, shear wave velocity, and damping ratio, on the overall transfer function of the system.
